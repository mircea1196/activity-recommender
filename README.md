# Activity Recommender

## Description

I think we all woke up in the next situation. You have a group of friends that you would like to meet and have fun with, but when you actually discuss the details it becomes a logistical problem to find a favorite activity of all the members of the group as well as a preferred time frame. If someone could organize the whole group and propose an activity to everyone's liking (online game, board games, cinema night) wouldn't it be perfect?
